Today I am solving the Sieve of Eratosthenes side exercise of the Exercism PHP track.
 In mathematics, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, 2.</description>

In the meanwhile, dstockto reviewed and approved my solution. ü§òüèº Funny story: He found my blog and saw my submission here before seeing it on Exercism.
He gave me an interesting additional challenge, to use &amp;ldquo;closed&amp;rdquo; form math-based solutions. This would also allow performance improvement, since the current implementation will take longer the larger $number is.
Square Of Sum For this function dstockto mentioned the Gauss formula.</description>
