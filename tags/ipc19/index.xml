      <description>This article is part of my #100DaysOfCode and #100DaysOfBlogging challenge. R1D16&#xA;Pragmatic Queue Processing at Scale By Arne Blankerts, Principal Consultant at thePHP.cc and Sebastian Heuer, Developer Advocate at kartenmacherei.de&#xA;Arne and Sebastian deliver messages from real world problems they tackled together. It&amp;rsquo;s not the first presentation of the duo. These sessions belong to the highlights of the conference (Casino night is still #1 😋). The talk gave a wonderful narrative overview of queue pressing, further readings of what might be of interest as well as learnings from their experience.</description>

R1D14&#xA;This was a great first day&#xA;How to make Loveliness: an HTML Treasure Hunt Keynote by Bruce Lawson, one of the editors of the W3C’s HTML5.3 specification&#xA;To me, this was the best keynote I have ever attended.
