 Pragmatic Queue Processing at Scale By Arne Blankerts, Principal Consultant at thePHP.cc and Sebastian Heuer, Developer Advocate at kartenmacherei.de
Arne and Sebastian deliver messages from real world problems they tackled together. It&amp;rsquo;s not the first presentation of the duo. These sessions belong to the highlights of the conference (Casino night is still #1 ðŸ˜‹). The talk gave a wonderful narrative overview of queue pressing, further readings of what might be of interest as well as learnings from their experience.</description>

 This was a great first day
How to make Loveliness: an HTML Treasure Hunt Keynote by Bruce Lawson, one of the editors of the W3Câ€™s HTML5.3 specification
To me, this was the best keynote I have ever attended. He presented a topic that could easily be boring and dry in a way that captured the audience&amp;rsquo;s (well at least my) full attention.</description>
