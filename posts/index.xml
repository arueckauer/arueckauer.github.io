<p>The idea of starting my own blog has accompanied me for years. Since I was afraid, it would not see regular updates and quickly become a lonesome tumbleweed, I&rsquo;ve never put it to action.</p>

<p>However I could never set aside having a tool to record and contain my thought. So here goes nothing.</p>

<h2 id="reasons-to-start-and-not-to-end">Reasons to start and (not) to end</h2>

<p>My main motivation of starting this blog is to have a</p>

<ul>
<li>journal to record my personal progress in software-development and possibly other topics of interest,</li>
<li>notepad for my learnings to go back to and</li>
<li>container for thoughts in gerneral.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are purely personal reasons and writing for an audience other than myself is not a priority at the moment. Also I am not getting payed for it, so this should be fun!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can we just have some fun?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>David Picciuto</em> from <a href="https://makesomething.com/" target="_blank">Make Something</a></p>

<p>I definitely do not want to pressure myself to create content on a defined regularity or to set any expectations on quality (which will be difficult).</p>

<h2 id="do-it">Do it</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_W._Kimball" target="_blank">Spencer W. Kimball</a>, an American business, civic, and religious leader, is said to have had a sign on his desk saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do it. Do it right. Do it right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I believe he meant with it is: The opportunity to get something accomplished will never be better or easier than right now. Putting something off will make it more difficult as time passes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this adventure, Gude Laune!</p>
