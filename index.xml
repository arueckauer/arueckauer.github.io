Most of our costumers provide Windows Servers for the PHP applications we implement and maintain for them. Although it has become much easier to get a PHP running under Windows than ten years ago, it&amp;rsquo;s still not the choice environment for a typical PHP web application.
Last year a co-worker and I discussed the possibility of providing each project with a Vagrant box for development purposes that runs a comparable setup as the production environment.</description>

Today I am solving the Difference of Squares of the PHP track on Exercism.
Exercism offers its users learning new programming languages through exercises with the valuable feedback of mentors. It currently has 50 different language tracks like C#, Go, Kotlin, TypeScript and many others. Head over to Exercism to join.
Introduction The source of this exercise is Problem 6 of the Euler project.</description>

 [The Twelve-Factor App] requires strict separation of config from code.
 Taken from factor three of The Twelve-Factor App.
Today I am studying about how to achieve this requirement making usage of phpdotenv in a Zend Expressive context.
I will not go into details on and advantages of this concept. A leave that up to other resources.</description>

Yesterday I ran into an issue where the build process of an application depended on a proper configured application. There is a distributed configuration file. But for the build process to run successfully, the distributed file has to be copied (and if necessary adjusted) manually.
I see some issues with that.
 Build has a dependency on configuration. The build process for an application should stay the same.</description>

Today I&amp;rsquo;m studying the Autoloader Optimization article of the Composer documentation.
Purpose The optimization is designed to reduce the performance impact of the autoloader. It is not intended for use in development as it will have undesired side-effects.
Optimization levels There are two levels of optimization and the second level comes with two options. These two options cannot be combined.</description>

Today I was working with keep a changelog, especially with Matthew Weier O&amp;rsquo;Phinney&amp;rsquo;s implementation of it. I am fascinated by the idea of managing the CHANGELOG from the command line.
Installation Setup is thanks to composer straight-forward. You can either install it locally or globally. I went with the latter.
composer global require phly/keep-a-changelog  If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, remember to add the global composer bin path to your PATH environment variable.</description>

Whenever starting a new Zend Expressive project, I use the handy zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton. It creates an almost empty Expressive application structure with your choice of
 code structure, DI container, router, template engine and error handler.  It comes also with two exemplary handlers and conditions for various routers and template engines. I wondered, what a cleaned-up skeleton would look like and how many bits and pieces were actually there which could be removed.</description>

This year I attended the Global Azure Bootcamp in Zürich. It was a very well organized conference with lots of interesting sessions. I definitely will go again next year!
One of my favorites was Terraform and Azure - How to GitOps by Sandro Koechli and Jörn Stenkamp. They introduced the idea of managing infrastructure as code with Git. This concept was new to me and very exciting.</description>

      <description>Lately quite a few posts on the #100DaysOfCode challenge have come up on my Twitter timeline. I was curious what it is all about. So, I started to do some research and I really liked what I was reading.
In this post I am writing about my own commitment to the challenge. If you want to know more about it yourself, start reading the initial article on medium or go straight to the official website.</description>

      <title>From Flat to Modular</title>

      <description>Transforming of a flat application structure to a modular one in a Zend Expressive project
In an Expressive project I ran into the issue, where the application grew much larger than initially expected. How about that? The project got initialized with a flat code structure, which is the default selection of the Expressive Skeleton. Flat basically means the application is organized in a single module in contrast to endless modules in the modular structure.</description>

      <description>The idea of starting my own blog has accompanied me for years. Since I was afraid, it would not see regular updates and quickly become a lonesome tumbleweed, I&amp;rsquo;ve never put it to action.
However I could never set aside having a tool to record and contain my thought. So here goes nothing.
Reasons to start and (not) to end My main motivation of starting this blog is to have a</description>
